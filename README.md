# C++ Programs
A repository of random C++ programs I made in class for fun. Most of these are niche, but some have practical uses. Right now, the repo is a little weak, but it will grow over time.

## Running the Programs
Most of these are pretty simple and were either made in [C++ Shell](https://cpp.sh) or [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/), so they can be run on most platforms (a keyboard is most ideal though!)

## Contributing
If there are any bugs you find or can optimize a program, fork this repo and submit a pull and I'll see what I can do!
