# C++ Programs
This is a repository of random C++ programs and somewhat useful headers I made in class for fun. Most of these are niche, but some have practical uses. Right now, the repo is quite empty, but it will grow over time.

## Running the Programs
Most of these are pretty simple and were either made in [C++ Shell](https://cpp.sh) or [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/), so they're super simple and can be run online and pretty much anywhere.

I might make `exe` releases in the future, but I have exams to be worrying about.

## Contributing
If there are any bugs you find or can optimizations to a program, fork this repo and submit a pull and I'll see what I can do!
